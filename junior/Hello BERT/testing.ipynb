They are simple and delicious and were not sold in the US back then. They are so good that I brought back two bags from a recent trip to Italy. It is great to see that they may now be found on Amazon!<br /><br />Note: it is great to open a bag, smell the contents, pour a glass of milk, then dip the Macines in the milk. Great routine and treat for kids!\"',\n  '\"I had heard a little about this product from the local pet store, then tried a small bag for our 2 cats of about 3 and 6 years respectively. The female, younger one took to it right away, and the older male, who was unfortunately weaned on the junk cat food with all the corn meal and etc... in it, and would usually refuse a diet change, actually liked it too. The older male is overweight and we were trying to switch him to soft food on the doctors request, but he totally refused it. He is a posh cat after all. He still consumes too many calories, the fatty, but at least I know hes eating good food. Of course, I know this product seems to cost more than most other feline food on the market, but I just cant see feeding our animals the lousy alternatives that are out there, marketed as being healthy. Why do commercials show cats eating a vegetarian diet which is mostly corn meal? Is that right? Ill stay with this for now, but stay tuned.<br /><br />Im updating this review after 9 months of using this cat food for our two cats. I upgraded the stars from 4 to 5 as it really has been a good food for the two of them. Garfield still eats a little too much, but hes just a big cat who doesnt exercise much, lets face it. Our female cat will be 4 years old in a couple months and shes so healthy. Shes tiny, but happy and agile. I tried the chicken version of Holistic Select, but Garfield seemd to miss this sardine version so we went back to this one. Ive ordered the duck version and will update this once they try it.\"',\n  '\"I started buying this after I noticed my 1 year old cat was already starting to lose his spunk so I decided it was time to start buying him real cat food...not the garbage in the super markets. I found this at the pet store out of the other million choices, and Im sure there are other brands that are just as good but this is the one I went with to try first and it was a great purchase. My cat has been on this for the past 8 months and hes now just has active as he was when he was a kitten and his coat has became sooo soft. Mainly, he loved the taste even more! I highly recommend this brand to all my friends and family for their animals!\"',\n  '\"I have done a lot of research to find the best food for my cat, and this is an excellent food.  That is also according to my holistic veterinarian.  They put probiotics on the kibble as the last step, which is very important to me.  The best thing is that my cat loved it immediately and I had to stop mixing it with the old food because she only would eat Holistic Select.\"',\n  'This cat food was recommended by my vet because my 13 year old Cleo Cat was having trouble keeping any food down and was loosing weight.  It stopped her problems.  She doesnt eat as much as before since she seems to be more satisfied after eating which helps justify the added price.  It aids in digestion since the...ok sorry...smells are gone if ya know what I mean.  Had to add that so anyone experiencing problems with their cats can see there are a lot of benifits from this cat food.',\n  '\"I have a 4 year old male cat who has chronic urinary tract infections.  I feed him this dry food in combination with wet food (with water added to it) and Uri Ease.  The combination seems to keeps his UTIs under control.  If I switch to another type of dry food, his UTI gets worse.  The other cats seem to enjoy this food as well.  Its expensive but it seems to be the best solution for me.\"',\n  '\"Before I was educated about feline nutrition, I allowed my cats to become addicted to dry cat food. I always offered both canned and dry, but wish I would have fed them premium quality canned food and limited dry food. I have two 15 year old cats and two 5 year old cats. The only good quality dry foods they will eat are Wellness and Innova. Innovas manufacturer was recently purchased by Procter&Gamble. I began looking for a replacement. After once again offering several samples (from my local holistic pet store) Holistic Select was the only one (other than the usual Wellness and Innova) they would eat. For finicky cats, I recommend trying Holistic Select. It is a good quality food that is very palatable for finicky eaters.\"',\n  '\"My holistic vet recommended this, along with a few other brands. We tried them all, but my cats prefer this (especially the sardine version). The best part is their coats are so soft and clean and their eyes are so clear. AND (and I dont want to be rude, so Ill say this as delicately as I can) their waste is far less odorous than cats who eat the McDonalds junk found in most stores, which is a definite plus for me! The health benefits are so obvious - I highly recommend Holistic Select!\"',\n  '\"One of my cats is allergic to fish and beef. This formula is one of the few she can eat, and it has much better ingredients than the prescription diets available at the vet. Both of my kitties are very active, have soft shiny fur, and neither are fat. Dry food reduces tartar buildup on teeth, also.\"',\n  'Our cats thrive extremely well on this dry cat food.  They definitely have much less hair ball throw ups and their fur is great.  They are fit and not over weight.  This vendor ships extremely fast.  Is one of the top Amazon suppliers in our book!',\n  '\"Ive been a fan of Hot & Spicy Maruchan Ramen for a long time. If you enjoy spice, and love ramen, youll love this product. Too bad its way too expensive here on Amazon. Its only $3.36 per 12 at my Walmart.\"',\n  '\"Ive been eating Ramen noodles since I was a little kid, and Ive never found a better flavor than Hot & Spicy Chicken!  It isnt hot at all to a chilihead like me, but it sure is good!\"',\n  '\"I LOVE spicy ramen, but for whatever reasons this thing burns my stomach badly and the burning sensation doesnt go away for like 3 hours! Not sure if that is healthy or not .... and you can buy this at Walmart for $0.28, way cheaper than Amazon.\"',\n  '\"Always being a fan of ramen as a quick and easy meal, finding it on amazon for a decent price and having it delivered to your door by the case is an amazing situation for anyone to find themselves in.\"',\n  '\"I must be a bit of a wuss, because this soup tastes to me how I imagine fire might taste. Typically I like spicy food if it has a good flavor.  I dont find this to be the case with this soup. Any flavor is killed off by the burn.\"',\n  'I really loved the spicy flavor these had.  I found myself liking the broth more than the noodles which is usually the opposite.  If you arent used to the heat this might bother you and if you like hot hot foods this might not be enough.',\n  '\"Got these on sale for roughly 25 cents per cup, which is half the price of my local grocery stores, plus they rarely stock the spicy flavors. These things are a GREAT snack for my office where time is constantly crunched and sometimes you cant escape for a real meal. This is one of my favorite flavors of Instant Lunch and will be back to buy every time it goes on sale.\"',\n  'i have bought allot of different flavors and this happens to be one of my favorites and will be getting more soon',\n  '\"I love this flavor of ramen! I dont eat other flavors anymore because they taste too bland by comparison. For the convenience of having it delivered to my home (I have prime, so I get it in two days and dont have to pay for the shipping), the price on amazon isnt bad at all, but it is still cheaper to run down and pick up a case of this at the grocery store.\"',\n  '\"The BEST investment Ive ever made for ginger. Its unbelievable! Its fibrous like the real ginger, has that spicy kick to it, but its perfect with the sugar - calms it down.  Its very worth the $40 for 5lbs of it!  Ill be getting more soon - I use these as a topper for my ginger cupcakes and cookies :)\"',\n  'Delicious. I cannot get Australian ginger where I live. This compares favorably to Australian Ginger Ive purchased in other cities. Now I can enjoy it without traveling.',\n  '\"I keep trying other brands.... cheaper brands. Stupid me! This ginger IS soooo worth the money. Tender, moist and never a let down.\"',\n  '\"My son has had acid reflux since birth and has been on every medication available with no improvement, Until an older gentleman came into his work place and told him about this product and I automatically ordered it for him. I was really not expecting any better results than the 1000 other things we have tried. What a surprise! He has not had any heartburn or symptoms since day 2 of starting eating one piece of this Ginger each morning. He can now eat anything and actually enjoy it. This product was a God send for him. Thank you all for it!\"',\n  'I bought this for our office to give people something sweet to snack on.  Because its bite size its easier for people to grab a couple a pieces rather than an entire licorice stick. My only complaint is that one of the bags broke open in shipping.',\n  'Twizzlers brand licorice is much better than that other well known brand.<br />If you can get these for $2 to $2.50 a package with free s/h its a good deal.<br />The black and cherry have good taste; but the strawberry taste was too delicate and barely there',\n  '\"I love these.........very tasty!!!!!!!!!!!  Infact, I think I am addicted to them.<br />Buying them in packs of 6 bags - is very reasonable than going to Target and getting a bag.  Savings are about a $1.00 a bag.  I use subscribe and save on these and several other product.  I love subscribe and save!!!!!!!!!!!\"',\n  '\"If you are looking for a less messy version of licorice for the children, then be sure to try these!  Theyre soft, easy to chew, and they dont get your hands all sticky and gross in the car, in the summer, at the beach, etc. We love all the flavos and sometimes mix these in with the chocolate to have a very nice snack! Great item, great price too, highly recommend!\"',\n  '\"I might be mistaken, but it appears that the pieces in this bag were reduced in size.  If they did do that, it was doubtlessly done to make it appear that the buyer got a better deal, having so many pieces after all.  The problem is that the pieces have to be a certain size in order to have enough flavor for your eating experience.  As it is, you have to use 2 or 3 pieces to match the old piece size;  it is not the same.\"',\n  '\"Being a fan of Newmans Pineapple salsa for quite a while, I was looking for a comparable salsa.  This is one of the best tasting salsas Ive ever had.  My daughters love it too.  They dont like super chunky salsa and the Berry Mango has a nice smooth texture with small mango pieces.  The salsa is not too sweet, just sweet enough and although its mild, it has a nice little kick to it.  At this price, its a steal!\"',\n  '\"The SALSA smelled delicious, as I think it probably was - but, unfortunately, the person, at AMAZON, that is a packer (there is probably several) had very little stuffing to work with, especially on the bottoms.  Therefore, the bottoms were broken on all three bottles. As I reached for my computer; I was told NO RETURNS (cause its a food item).  I then looked for a CUSTOMER SERVICE tag; and I found none on their NEW FACE LIFT.  THEY SEEM TO BE PROUD OF THEIR NEW FACE LIFT BUT...THEY SHOULD AT LEAST HAVE A PLACE TO CONTACT THEM IN EMERGENCIES!  LIKE: I BUY A LOT OF STUFF AND IT ALL COMES IN STYROFOAM BOXES.  NEVER WOULD I SHIP THINGS<br />ESPECIALLY SALSA - IN A CARDBOARD BOX WITH JUST A STRIPE OF LARGE BUBBLE WRAP ON IT.

S.\"',\n  'This is one of the best salsas that I have found in a long time but stay away from the variety pack. The other two that come with it are not worth your money.',\n  'These remind me of dog treats I made once using pumpkin and cinnamon. Theyre kind of bland and not my favorite Back To Nature product. But my finace really loves them so thats where the three stars come from.',\n  '\"This is the best cornmeal. I made regular cornbread and hot water cornbread with this meal and both were outstanding. Also fried some oysters with this meal, it gave them a great texture and flovor.\"',\n  '\"This is a fabulous marinade!  I love to use it for chicken, either baked in the oven OR on the grill.  This has enough flavor & flair, Ive even used it for dinner parties, only to receive rave reviews from my guests!! DEFINITELY worth the price! Super cheap and super easy!

I will definitentally be purchasing this product again the flavor was so wonderful.',\n  '\"I went to 4 grocery stores looking for this flavor of Jello for my green tomato jam recipe and finally found it here. This jello is wonderful! Evidently its only carried in the stores during the summer but with harvest time in the Fall, I couldnt find it anywhere in town. This Jello tastes like watermelon and the jam recipe I made with it takes like watermelon jam! Great made as regular Jello too. Yummy!\"',\n  'What a deal this is the healthiest salt you can use.

The taste of the tuna was not pleasant, too much basil and other spices for me.\"',\n  '\"Im not familiar with the Safcol brand but being a tuna addict, gave this a shot. The tuna tastes like its good quality but I found the tomato basil flavor to be a bit bland. Its better than something plain but it didnt pack the punch I was hoping for.

Now, I have had my fair share of cinnamon coffee cakes, but, let me just tell you that the FantasiCakes Cinnamon Coffee Cake really takes the cake with size, price, quality and taste.<br />The cake arrived very fast and was carefully packaged so that it arrived in almost perfect condition. It also comes with a large tub of white icing that you can drizzle over the top, before serving. I couldnt believe how large the size was and it actually fed my family of 5 for us to enjoy during breakfast, for three days. The cake itself is thick and almost has a solid but sponge cake type consistency that is really moist and very filling. The flavors are to die for with the sticky cinnamon outside and sweet cinnamon and vanilla swirled throughout the inside of the cake. The icing really tops it off beautifully and gives it that moist and sticky sweet flavor.

After about 30 minutes, I was ready for bed! I woke up refreshed and with no sleepy-drug hangover, so that is a huge bonus.<br /><br />I gave the product 3 stars (instead of the 5 it deserves) as their packing job was marginal at best. The product arrived with 2 broken bottles, which at this price is a $6 loss! The bottles are glass and all they did was wrap one layer of the small-bubbled bubble wrap around the case and placed it in a larger box with extra room to move around in that box. Big packing fail, but the product is awesome.\"',\n  '\"We made chocolate chip cookies with BRM Garbanzo Bean Flour and the results were fantastic!  The brown sugar and chocolate mask any bean taste that other reviews have mentioned.  Our friends couldnt discern any difference from classic CCCs.  The texture, body, and elasticity (meaning reduced tendency to fall apart that occurs with most other gluten-free flours) is nice and chewy -- the same as CCCs made with regular flour.  And an added bonus -- the high protein and fiber level (I calculate 2-3 g fiber/cookie) fills you up so that you are satisfied with smaller servings and the glycemic index is significantly lower.<br /><br />I highly recommend this flour even if CCCs are the only thing you make with it.\"',\n  'This  is great stuff.  Made some really tasty banana bread.  Good quality and lowest price in town.',\n  '\"We had trouble finding this locally - delivery was fast, no more hunting up and down the flour aisle at our local grocery stores.\"',\n  '\"This packet of glaze is the secret to making those European style fresh fruit tarts. I am about to make one for a pie auction at church, after a friend requested that something strawberry should be offered. You can make the most amazing and relatively healthy fruit tarts by baking a base, layering it with uncooked, fresh, sliced fruit, then pouring over the made-up contents of one of these packets. They harden up at room temperature, hold the fruit together so you can slice the tart, and they let the beauty of the arranged fruit show through. Ive also seen this glaze used over cheesecakes, to hold a fruit topping in place. Personally, I do not like cheesecake (too rich for me) but a fruit glazed cheesecake is gorgeous, I will admit. To do this, slice fruit and layer it on the cheesecake while its still in the springform pan. Pour on the glaze, let it set up and then remove the springform. Youll have a clear layer of fruit on top of the cheesecake. Cherries, strawberries or sliced mangos are nice, but the best one I ever had used thin slices of lemons, that had been gently poached in sugar syrup before they were layered on the cake.<br /><br />I use a base of sponge cake, baked in a shallow form, but other bases can be pate sucre  (a kind of French pastry that is a bit like a sugar cookie) that works well in those fluted, straight-sided forms. You can also make mini-tarts in a muffin pan, pre-baking each mold with a layer of pie crust (even commercial crust works, though again, I prefer pate sucre, it holds its shape better and is more substantial and has a better crumb.) Just blind-bake the muffin tins lined with pate, then pop them out and fill with fresh fruits (berries are great) and pour over the glaze. Some people put a layer of creme patisserie, which is a pastry cream like custard but stabilized with flour,  below the fruit and I happen to think these taste best.<br /><br />If you get into baking, this glaze is a must-have on the shelf. The ingredients are vegan: tapioca starch, carrageenan, dextrose, cream of tartar, locust bean gum, so if you are looking to make a vegan tofu cheesecake, you can use this on top, as well as use it for fruit tarts with a nut crust base.\"',\n  '\"My Scotties were full of hot spots and when I used this within a week all the hot spots were gone.

One co-worker asked me to save the tins for her so she could use them as pillboxes and safety pin boxes. Like I said, theyre a real hit. Since I wouldnt be able to keep my hands off a candy dish, this is a good alternative to have around and its nice to have them around if I have garlic for lunch! I gave the item 4 stars because they arent as tasty as the sugar version of the mints  but what sugar free item is as good as its full sugar counterpart?) and because of the fact that each tin is wrapped in plastic which seems like a waste and is irritating to remove (although I totally get why they wrap it - it still doesnt make it easy to deal with).\"',\n  '\"The tiny Altoids are great for a quick breath freshening and the small box is great for portability.

They loved the Purina. They loved the Nutro. They loved the Iams. They love whatever we feed them.<br /><br />This review is based on what we, their affectionate owners love. After a certain age, we were instructed by the vet to consider senior foods- and lower carb foods, because the catties were fatties. We tried a few types of food. Some evinced no change. Some made the litter super-stink.  Some had too small a kibble and the cats barfed it up because they didnt have to chew it to swallow it...<br /><br />This Felidae has done the trick. No problems to speak of. It is consistent in the litter and bearable on the nose. The cats love it. The kibble is sized appropriate to chewing. And heres the kicker:<br />After feeding the cats Felidae, their demeanor improved. Their coats are super soft and lush- both are new improvements we can directly attribute to this food. Were now loyal Felidae consumers.<br /><br />Additionally, the absence of corn product in the feed seems to lessen or remove the reactions of our friends with cat-allergies.\"',\n  '\"I started my cat on Felidae Platinum about 3 weeks ago and she loves it. Shes an older cat, somewhat overweight, and had a grouchy temperament. I first mixed it with her previous food and she figured out which was which -- she ate the Felidae and left the old food! Shes now been on just the Felidae for about ten days now, off the old food entirely, and she is a much sweeter, happier cat. I think it must agree with her better or be more easily digested, or something. In any case, I am a happy purchaser of Felidae. I dont agree with the previous reviewer that cats dont like it. Clearly, mine does.\"',\n  '\"We have three cats, the youngest is about eleven years old, another is fifteen and our oldest is, well ancient.  That is what the vet told us ten years ago.  The youngest is a blob.  When he lays down, he looks like a footstool. The other two are arthritic and skinny.<br /><br />Since we had such success with Canidae Platinum for senior dogs, I figured that wed give it a try for our cats.  Id had them on low ash Purina One Urinary tract formula for their entire lives and thankfully we had no UT problems.<br /><br />Buster, the youngest, is still a blob after six months plus on Felidae for Senior and Overweight cats.  However, the other two are now much more active and we can tell that they are really feeling better since we changed their food to Felidae.  Even Prissy, the ancient one has started to play and tease the dogs by getting them to chase her, where before when she was on Purina One, all she wanted to do was to sleep.<br /><br />I think that if you can get your cat on this fairly early in their weight problems, itll be more effective.<br /><br />However, the glucosamine will certainly help your older fur balls have a happier life.\"',\n  '\"Too much of a good thing? We worked this kibble in over time, slowly shifting the percentage of Felidae to national junk-food brand until the bowl was all natural. By this time, the cats couldnt keep it in or down. What a mess. Weve moved on.\"',\n  '\"As with canidae, Felidae has also changed their formula.  Cats do not like change when it comes to their food.  And they just had to change it without putting it on their label.  We noticed the color of the food had changed and so did the smell.  (As you will notice I have also reviewd the Canidae, and this all happened the same time the dogs were having issues.)<br /><br />Prior to the change in food we had almost lost two of our cats because we had moved to a new home.  If cats get upset because of a change in enviorment, or a loud noise they can stop eating.  It depends on the cat.  Two of them had stopped eating and had lost a lot of weight.  We took them to the vet and it took months to get them back to normal.  It has been a year since then and they are better.  Then the formula for this food changed.<br /><br />We started to noitce they were not eating as much and it started to bug us.  We asked the shop owner of the feed store and she had no knowledge of any change to the food.  It wasnt until the we were in there with other customers yelling about their dogs food making their dogs sick.  Right away we changed the cats food and they started chowing down and havent suffered one bit like our dogs have.<br /><br />Cats are sensitve animals and changes to thier food could cause them to stop eating.  Anyone thinking of purchasing this food should not do it!  We have 5 rescued and fixed cats, none of which are picky eaters and the change in this formula could have been the death of them had we not found out about the change in their formula.<br /><br />I urge anyone that has had these problems to go to the consumer affairs website and also the FDA website and write a letter to them to let them know how this has affected your animal.  As with canidae they do not care how the change has affected my animals, and tell me not to buy it.  This is just horrible!\"',\n  'Dont buy just a few of these!  I order these by the case.

It definitely makes you sweat a bit when youre eating it. It was still edible to us by adding a good sized dollop of sour cream but I dont think I would buy it again due to the heat. We prefer the milder McCormicks brand of Fajita mix. Ive also had fajitas in a couple of different restaurants and it wasnt as spicy as this mix is.<br /><br />If you like super spicy then this is not burning hot so you might want to keep that in mind. To me it was more than medium hot but not by too much.<br /><br />I gave it three stars because it was pretty easy to make and its versatile in that you could vary the veggies you put in it. You take a plastic bag, a couple of tbs of vegetable oil, 1/4 cup water and mix the seasoning, water and oil together then add the chicken strips to the bag and let it marinate for 5 minutes. In the meantime, it says to stir fry your veggies (peppers and onion) but I found it easier to just cook the chicken and veggies together and I dont think it affected quality or taste.

Aside from the Lapsang Souchong, I think this is a great replacement for all the rest.

So I have been searching for a quality full bodied tea that wasnt bitter at a more palatable price point, and this certainly fits the bill. And unlike some other teas where they tend to be better in one form or another, i.e. iced vs. hot, this tea is excellent in both forms. I would certainly recommend this to anyone who prefers that smooth full bodied quality tea that doesnt cost an arm and leg.\"',\n  '\"I drink this tea plain (without sugar or milk), and it has a pleasant aroma.<br /><br />The price from Amazon is cheaper than my local grocery store.  One reviewer is right, I think it has some herbal smell to make up the aroma.

I usually prefer White Chinese tea, like White Peony, but it is more expensive, and requires lower temperature water.  But this is black tea, and this aroma kind of remind me the softness of white tea.\"',\n  '\"Ive tried a variety of Ahmad tea.

It gives a satisfying and relaxing finish to a busy day.<br /><br />For those interested in the specifics: I use about 3 teaspoons of lose tea in a stainless steel infuser in a 16 oz mug, let it steep in 208F water for 2-3 min, take the infuser out, and drink it without sugar or milk to savor its sophistication.\"',\n  '\"I have tried literally dozens of teas since being introduced to the Russian custom of preparing and drinking tea, and the Ahmad Imperial blend is probably my favorite of all of these due to the fact that it is equally delicious hot or iced.

Never have I seen such gas issues. Both of them consistently had foul gas. Consistently. Usually when theyre sitting on our laps but, you know. Theyre dogs.<br /><br />When we got through the first bag of this stuff, we purchased more on amazon.

I mean, they loved the food, dont get me wrong and they loved it more when wed mix in some water and it would be like soft food. Somehow that made their gas worse but I think Ill have to give that responsible to the speed with which they chowed down- cant blame the food itself for gluttony.<br /><br />Eventually, we switched their food. No more farting. I think it was due to the high fat content which undoubtedly is necessary for very small puppies. They just need that in their diet. I think that we were advised to keep them on it for much longer than was useful (they said up until 1 year). Yeah right, you try dealing with gas for that long.
